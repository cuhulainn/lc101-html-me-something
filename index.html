                        <h1>The Beginning</h1>
                        
                        <p>Since I was young, I've been a techie.  In fact, I'm a tech genius... according to my grandma.</p>
                        
                        <p>I got my first computer circa 1988, an Intel 286. I was a regular on several BBS systems, played some games, and learned to make basic repairs and upgrades to my computer.  I quickly became my family's 'tech guy' and often helped people manage their virus problems, hard drive crashes, and other issues.  So I'd regularly go to my grandma's house to troubleshoot her issues... </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grammy: "It doesn't turn on"</li>
                            <li>Me: &lt;plugs it back in &gt;<br></li>
                            <li>Grammy: "The browser is running slow"</li>
                            <li>Me: &lt;uninstalls 12 toolbars &gt;<br></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>My work for my grammy led to her firmly believing that I was a genius and making sure the whole family knew it. Though she's passed, and despite the fact that I've always insisted that my magic powers actually boil down to little more than this:</p>

                        </figure> 
                        <p>But... the legend lives on in my family anyway.  I've decided to go all in and embrace it.  I'm gonna be the genius she always thought I was, by being a life-long learner and finding innovative ways to contribute value to the ever more interconnected worlds of technology and business.</p>

                    <section id="middle">
                        <h1>The Journey</h1>
                        
                        <p>My journey began in business, specifically in the travel industry.  Through several varied roles in travel agencies, I discovered and developed an aptitude for operations, problem solving, process development and improvement, and managing people.  I learned about business operations by working in and on them, and then decided to pursue additional academic business knowledge, by taking advantage of the fact that I'd just moved to a country where I didn't speak the language, and went back to school to get my MBA.  After learning the new language and earning my MBA and accumulating some international experience, I brought my family back to the US and brought my experience to a more tech centered industry - telecom.  Here I refined my knowledge and gained more experience with business operations, logistics, quality management systems, strategic planning, and software development.</p>
                        
                        <p>Though all the things I learned in this latest role were valuable, it was the exposure to software development that re-ignited my passion and desire to be contributing to the world of technology in more direct ways.  I managed our relationship with small software development team and worked with them to build two separate proprietary pieces of software.  I helped design and test features, prioritized bug fixes and feature additions, and generally ensured the project was meeting the needs of the business and providing both value and the functionality the business needed.</p>

                    <section id="end">
                        <h1>The Present and Future</h1>
                        
                        <p>When the time came to move on from my position at Ascension Mobile, I decided that my path forward would be focused on bringing my business experience together with my passion for technology.  I spoke with friends, mentors, developers, and other experienced IT professionals about the best way to go about this.  There were varied pieces of advice I received, but a common thread emerged:  You have valuable soft skills and business experience that the tech industry really needs.  You don't have the tech skills or background, but those things can be learned.  The best way to acheive this knowledge is through LaunchCode.</p>
                        <p>I started LaunchCode in April 2019 and will graduate from the program in the fall.</p>
                        <p>Between LaunchCode and self-directed learning, I've acheived some literacy in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>C</li>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Python</li>
                            <li>HTML and CSS (this website being my first foray into this realm!)</li>
                            <li>Git/Github/VCS</li>
                            <li>Flask</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And by the time I graduate, I'll add:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Java</li>
                            <li>SQL</li>
                            <li>Spring Boot</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition to having a solid base with all of this technical knowledge, I have an immense desire and ability to learn, add value, and contribute to the increasingly integrated worlds of technology and business.  I have strong communication skills, both written and verbal.  I am detail oriented while being able to keep sight of the bigger picture.  I function well leading or being a member of teams and working cross-functionally across departments.</p>
                        <p>I'm looking to bring all of my skills and abilities to bear in my next role.  I see myself bringing value as a consultant or part of a support team, but am continuing to explore my options and find a role that will be a great fit for myself and my next employer. </p>
